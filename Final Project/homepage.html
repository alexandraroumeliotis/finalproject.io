					<h3>Optic Eye</h3>
					<p>Optic Eye is amobile application and 3D printed lens to diagnose rare neurological disorders through using computer vision to detect optic disc swelling. I programmed this application after my grandfather was diagnsoed with a brain aneurysm that caused him to lose his vision. Frustrated by the lack of access to health care in low income immigrant communities, I wanted to find a way that people like my grandfather would have access to at-home healthcare and diagnostics.</p>
