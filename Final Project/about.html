				<h2>About Alexandra Roumeliotis</h2>
				<p>I was born in Montreal, Canada, and moved to San Francisco with my family when I was 1 years old. I loved growing up in San Francisco, as well as being constantly exposed to technology, where I found an interest and passion in computer science. However, my family and I continue to stay true to our roots, and spend Christmas with our family back in Canada. I am passionate about harnessing technology to solve real world problems. In high school, I created an nonprofit organization to expose underrepresented students in technology. My senior year of highschool, I built an application to diagnose my grandfather's rare brain disorder. I am passionate an interested about harnessing technology to solve accessibility and healthcare issues around the world.</p>
